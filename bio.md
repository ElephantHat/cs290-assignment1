About Me
--------
I am in my final term in the OSU Ecampus CS degree program. I like reading, watching movies, playing games, and being ignored by my cat while trying to play with her.

Also, I am pretty awesome, and that's not just hubris. I know, because my mom told me so, and she wouldn't lie to me.

Additionally, I like pie.

Programming Background
----------------------
Wrote my own version of "Nibbles" in QBASIC when I was in high school. Sadly, the source is lost forever.

Collaborated on a neat database project for cs275. See it here: http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burleigb/275/project/
